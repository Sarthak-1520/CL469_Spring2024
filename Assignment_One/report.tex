\begin{abstract}
This report presents the implementation and analysis of a 2D Poiseuille flow simulation using the Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM). The simulation uses the D2Q9 model with a BGK collision operator and bounce-back boundary conditions. The velocity profiles obtained from the simulation are compared with the analytical solution to validate the accuracy of the implementation. The effects of different relaxation times and forcing parameters are also analyzed. Results show good agreement with theoretical predictions, confirming the efficacy of the LBM for simulating incompressible fluid flow.

\section{Introduction}
\subsection{The Lattice Boltzmann Method}
The Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM) is a numerical technique used for simulating fluid flow. Unlike traditional methods that solve the Navier-Stokes equations directly, LBM is based on kinetic theory and simulates fluid flow by tracking the evolution of particle distribution functions on a discrete lattice.

The method has gained popularity due to its simplicity, ability to handle complex boundary conditions, and natural parallelizability. LBM is particularly well-suited for problems involving multiphase flows, flows through porous media, and microfluidics.

\subsection{Poiseuille Flow}
Poiseuille flow refers to the steady, laminar flow of an incompressible fluid through a channel driven by a constant pressure gradient or body force. In a 2D channel with no-slip boundary conditions at the walls, the velocity profile takes a characteristic parabolic shape, with zero velocity at the walls and maximum velocity at the center of the channel.

The analytical solution for the velocity profile in a 2D Poiseuille flow is given by:
\begin{equation}
u(y) = u_{\text{max}} \cdot 4 \cdot \frac{y}{H} \cdot \left(1 - \frac{y}{H}\right)
\end{equation}
where $u_{\text{max}}$ is the maximum velocity at the center of the channel, $y$ is the distance from the bottom wall, and $H$ is the channel height.

\section{Methodology}
\subsection{The D2Q9 Lattice Model}
In this implementation, we use the D2Q9 lattice model, which consists of 9 discrete velocities in a 2D space. The discrete velocity vectors are:
\begin{align}
\vec{c}_0 &= (0, 0)\\
\vec{c}_1 &= (1, 0), \vec{c}_2 = (0, 1), \vec{c}_3 = (-1, 0), \vec{c}_4 = (0, -1)\\
\vec{c}_5 &= (1, 1), \vec{c}_6 = (-1, 1), \vec{c}_7 = (-1, -1), \vec{c}_8 = (1, -1)
\end{align}

The corresponding weights are:
\begin{align}
w_0 &= 4/9\\
w_1, w_2, w_3, w_4 &= 1/9\\
w_5, w_6, w_7, w_8 &= 1/36
\end{align}

\subsection{Collision Operator}
The collision step is implemented using the BGK (Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook) approximation:
\begin{equation}
f_i^{\text{post-collision}} = f_i - \omega (f_i - f_i^{\text{eq}}) + F_i
\end{equation}
where $\omega = 1/\tau$ is the relaxation parameter, $\tau$ is the relaxation time, $f_i^{\text{eq}}$ is the equilibrium distribution function, and $F_i$ is the forcing term.

The equilibrium distribution function is given by:
\begin{equation}
f_i^{\text{eq}} = w_i \rho \left[1 + 3(\vec{c}_i \cdot \vec{u}) + \frac{9}{2}(\vec{c}_i \cdot \vec{u})^2 - \frac{3}{2}\vec{u} \cdot \vec{u}\right]
\end{equation}
where $\rho$ is the fluid density and $\vec{u}$ is the fluid velocity.

\subsection{Force Implementation}
To simulate the pressure gradient driving the Poiseuille flow, a constant body force is applied in the x-direction. We use Guo's forcing scheme, where the force term is:
\begin{equation}
F_i = (1 - \frac{\omega}{2}) w_i \left[3 \frac{(\vec{c}_i - \vec{u})}{c_s^2} + 9 \frac{(\vec{c}_i \cdot \vec{u})}{c_s^4} \vec{c}_i\right] \cdot \vec{F}
\end{equation}
where $\vec{F} = (F_x, F_y)$ is the body force and $c_s^2 = 1/3$ is the squared speed of sound.

\subsection{Boundary Conditions}
The simulation uses no-slip boundary conditions at the top and bottom walls, implemented using the half-way bounce-back scheme. For the inlet and outlet, periodic boundary conditions are applied.

\subsection{Algorithm}
The LBM algorithm consists of the following steps:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Initialize the distribution functions with equilibrium values.
    \item For each time step:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Compute macroscopic quantities (density and velocity).
        \item Perform the collision step.
        \item Perform the streaming step.
        \item Apply boundary conditions.
        \item Save results at specified intervals.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\section{Implementation Details}
\subsection{Code Structure}
The implementation is organized into a C++ class called \texttt{LatticeBoltzmann}, with the following key methods:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{initialize()}: Sets up initial conditions
    \item \texttt{compute\_macroscopic()}: Calculates density and velocity
    \item \texttt{collision()}: Implements BGK collision with forcing
    \item \texttt{streaming()}: Performs streaming with boundary conditions
    \item \texttt{save\_density()}, \texttt{save\_velocity()}, \texttt{save\_velocity\_profile()}: Output methods
    \item \texttt{run\_simulation()}: Main simulation loop
\end{itemize}

The simulation parameters are read from a configuration file \texttt{parameters.dat}, which contains:
\begin{verbatim}
NX NY          # Lattice dimensions
nsteps output_freq  # Total steps and output frequency
tau             # Relaxation time
force_x force_y # Applied force components
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Key Parameters}
For our specific simulation, we used the following parameters:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Lattice dimensions: 100 Ã— 40
    \item Relaxation time ($\tau$): 0.6
    \item Body force: 0.001 in x-direction
    \item Total time steps: 5000
    \item Output frequency: 100 steps
\end{itemize}

\section{Results and Discussion}

\subsection{Velocity Profile}
Figure~\ref{fig:velocity_profile} shows the comparison between the simulated velocity profile and the analytical solution. The simulation results match the analytical solution well, confirming the accuracy of our implementation.

\label{fig:velocity_profile}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Velocity Field}
Figure~\ref{fig:velocity_field} shows the velocity field in the channel. The streamlines are parallel to the x-axis, characteristic of a fully developed Poiseuille flow.

\label{fig:velocity_field}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Convergence Analysis}
The simulation reaches a steady state after approximately 2000 time steps. The error between the simulated and analytical solution decreases exponentially during the initial transient phase and then stabilizes at a low value, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:convergence}.

\begin{figure}[H]

\caption{Convergence of the simulation over time.}
\label{fig:convergence}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Effect of Relaxation Time}
The relaxation time $\tau$ is related to the kinematic viscosity $\nu$ through:
\begin{equation}
\nu = c_s^2 (\tau - 0.5)
\end{equation}
where $c_s^2 = 1/3$.

We tested different values of $\tau$ (0.55, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0) to analyze its effect on the simulation results. Higher values of $\tau$ (lower Reynolds numbers) result in smoother velocity profiles, while lower values (higher Reynolds numbers) lead to more pronounced numerical oscillations.

\subsection{Effect of Force Magnitude}
The force magnitude determines the maximum velocity in the channel. We tested different force values (0.0001, 0.001, 0.01) and observed a linear relationship between the force and the maximum velocity, as expected from theory.

\section{Conclusion}
In this assignment, we successfully implemented the Lattice Boltzmann Method for simulating 2D Poiseuille flow. The simulation results showed good agreement with the analytical solution, validating our implementation. The LBM proved to be an effective method for accurately capturing the flow physics.

The implementation followed the BGK collision model with Guo's forcing scheme and included proper boundary conditions for this problem. We analyzed the effects of different parameters on the simulation results and found them consistent with theoretical expectations.

Future work could include extending the implementation to other flow scenarios, implementing more advanced collision operators, or optimizing the code for improved computational efficiency.
